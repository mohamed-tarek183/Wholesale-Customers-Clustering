# Wholesale-Customers-Clustering
In this project, we aim to explore clustering techniques on the Wholesale Customers dataset, a dataset
containing annual spending amounts (in monetary units) of various product categories for different clients
of a wholesale distributor. The dataset provides insights into the purchasing behavior of different types
of customers. Our goal is to apply K-means clustering to the dataset and visualize the clusters in a lowerdimensional
space using PCA. We will also use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of
clusters and evaluate the clustering performance.
